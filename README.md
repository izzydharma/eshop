## Refleciton 1

I use some clean code priciples in this code for example like meaningful names like ```ProductController```, ```ProductService```, and ```createProductPage``` that clearly describe their purpose. also It follows the Single Responsibility Principle, where each class has a distinct role, for example ```ProductController``` handles HTTP requests. The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle is applied by avoiding code duplication, as seen in ```ProductServiceImpl```, which uses ```ProductRepository``` for CRUD operations. Additionally, the code is consistently formatted with proper indentation and spacing. Secure coding practices are also implemented, such as using dependency injection via Spring's ```@Autowired``` annotation for better dependency management and testability, and handling exceptions appropriately, such as throwing runtime exceptions for missing products during updates. However, improvements can be made in error handling by introducing custom exceptions like ```ProductNotFoundException``` and global exception handlers. Furthermore, input validation in ```ProductController``` methods should be enhanced by using annotations like ```@Valid``` and ```@NotNull``` to prevent processing invalid data.
